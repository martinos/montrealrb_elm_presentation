# Purely Functional

> 1. The function always evaluates the same result value given the same argument value(s).
> 2. Evaluation of the result does not cause any semantically observable side effect or output, such as mutation of mutable objects or output to I/O devices (usuallyâ€”see below).


# No side effects
since it always returns the same thing. It makes it easier to reason about. It makes the function trustable. It will always say the same thing to you if you ask it something. It's not an hypocrite.
